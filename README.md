# Data Science Evaluation Tasks
Please submit the completed tasks to A/Prof Amir Aryani by email.  


## Knowledge Extraction and AI
Objective: Testing skills and capabilities in dealing with large data.

A large corpus of publications related to COVID19 research is available in the following repositories. Please review these datasets, and apply clustering, topic modelling, NLP or other techniques to address the following questions:

* JSON Files: [https://github.com/soda-lab/sept-2020/blob/master/covid19-json.zip]()
* GraphML: [https://github.com/soda-lab/sept-2020/blob/master/covid19.graphml.zip]()


### Task 1: Knowledge mining
What are the overall themes and topics of publications? And how we can group them in different groups based on their title, abstract, keywords and other information available in the publication metadata?

**Recommendations:**

* There are useful related methods available at [https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)
* Jupyter notebook is the best way to communicate the results

### Task 2: Network Analytics.
How can we effective visualise the collaboration network? How we can identify communities? Highly impactful universities? And understand the growth of the network as a time-serries from early 2020? 

**Recommendations:**

* Gephi is a capable tool for this task including visualisation and network analytics. 
* PowerPoint presentation with written notes would be the best way to communicate the results. 


## Place-based data, GIS and Visualisation
Objective:  Testing skills and capability in working with public data sources, mapping data using GIS tools and data visualisation using PowerBI or Tableau.

Please use the following data sources to address the following tasks:

### Task 3: Indicators of psychological stress
Identify open datasets that can represent psychological stress across Melbourne such as feeling safe in the neighbourhood, feeling discrimination, or experiencing family violence. 

**Recommendation:** 
* The results can be presented as ArcGIS or QGIS maps.


### Task 4: Visualisation CENSUS data
Identify and visualise the household family structure in the municipalities of Bayside, Boroondara, Glen Eira, and Stonnington. The data is required at SA1, SA2 and SA4 levels.
 
**Recommendation:** 

* Using Power BI, Tableau or ArcGIS online for this task would be effective.
